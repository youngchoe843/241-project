I like to give an estimate through email, so I can reference what we discuss.  I have just a few questions,     -Your full name and best contact phone number?  -Your address? -Square footage of your home? -Do you have any indoor animals? -How many people live in the home? -Do you have Stainless Steel Appliances? -Do you have wood floors?  linoleum? Tile? Mostly carpet?  The first cleaning is an hourly rate, I send a 3-person team for $90 an hour.  If for some reason I were to only have 2 workers the day they come the rate would be $75 an hour for 2.  They will bring all the supplies needed for the cleaning.  This is a good time to make a list of anything Special or extras you would like.    We have some great workers many have been with us for years, 3 of them over 17 years.  6 of them over 9 years.  They deep clean the first cleaning then I talk with the team and I determine the lower ongoing price.  I will know the ongoing price after the first cleaning.   After you have answered the questions I will be able to give you an idea of how long it may take for the first cleaning and an idea of the ongoing price.

Kumon's has our own curriculum which trains students to master the subject before moving on to higher level.  This is just the nature of the subject - math.

My name is Greta and I am the Instructor at the Kumon Centers of El Cerrito & Pinole.  Our El Cerrito center is located at 11100 San Pablo Avenue.  We hold classes on Tuesdays/Fridays.  Pinole center is located at 2860 Pinole Valley Road. Classes are held on Mondays/Thursdays.  Students can come anytime between 3-6 pm and stay about 20-30 minutes per subject.  We close at 7 pm.  Kumon is an after-school math and reading program that unlocks the potential of children by helping them achieve more on their own. Whether students are seeking an academic challenge or need help catching up, our individualized programs allow them to advance at their own pace, instilling in them a passion and desire to learn more. They become more motivated to succeed both in and out of the classroom.  Kumon students (ages 3 to adults) see success from the very start. The Kumon placement test will show us what level your child will start in. This will be a comfortable level, where they can achieve success immediately and begin to gain confidence. Your child will then advance step by step. We work on one concept at time allowing your child to master that concept before moving onto the next set of more challenging work.  The Kumon math program begins with counting and ends with advanced applications of calculus. Our reading comprehension program starts by developing pre-reading skills and progresses to critique and analysis of literary works. To complete a Kumon program means that a student has developed into a committed, passionate and industrious self-learner who has all the skills necessary to reach their potential.  If you would like to schedule a free placement test for your child, please contact me at 510-698-2720 or E-mail me to gretachang@ikumon.com. Our monthly tuition is $145 per subject (Math and Reading both for $290 with six-month mandatory enrollment.  Or with one-year commitment, the monthly tuition is $135 per subject ($270 for two subjects). Additional one time fee:  registration fee $50, material fee $30, and administrative fee $20 will apply.  There is a free registration promotion in November.  Thank you once again for your inquiry. The next new family orientation will be Thursday, 11/30, at 6:30 pm in Pinole.  The student needs to come with you.  Please call or e-mail me to confirm the appointment.  I am looking forward to meeting with you to further discuss the program.  Please visit our website:  www.kumon.com/pinole or www.kumon.com/el-cerrito.  Greta Chang, Instructor  510-235-8666 (El Cerrito)  510-724-3000 (Pinole)

Lisa Harp <lisa@harpinstitute.com>|Re: Cost for math tutoring|11/29/2017 21:54:36|12/2/2017 15:19:22|Hi Tyrone,  We don't do hourly tutoring.¬† We offer a program that involves teaching  academics along with strengthening the building blocks of learning that  might be weak and interfering with math or learning success.¬† For  instance, usually a 15 year-old student is weak in knowing math facts,  and this is because visual memory is weak. It's important to take the  student back, fill in the weak spots like visual memory, as well as  teach the academics.¬† This is the only way to get the student up to  speed and not need tutoring services for the rest of the student's  academic career.  I can tell you more about our program if you're interested.¬† We do  tuition based billing.¬† Our least expensive packet is $220.00 per month.  You can email me if you would like more information on our program or  call me at (209)304-5789.  Thanks,  Lisa

Support Team Oak Plumbing <support@oak.plumbing>|Re: Cost for water heater replacement|11/30/2017 9:44:00|12/4/2017 07:55:20|We provide up-front pricing which means you know the exact cost of the project before work begins. We have a $49 evaluation fee which covers my technician's time to do a complete evaluation of the system, provide multiple options for repair/replacement, and give you up-front, set in stone pricing. We also incorporate that $49 into the cost of any repair/replacement option so that does not end up being a separate charge. We have technicians in the area and would be honored to help you with this project.

Unfortunately our rack is tied up through next week. If you are in immediate need of an alignment, I would suggest calling United Auto Center on Petaluma Hill Rd. Their Phone # is 707-545-4267.
