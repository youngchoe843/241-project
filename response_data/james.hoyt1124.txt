Could you please provide me with a few pictures of your water heater so we can asses if there any code upgrades that are needed to make this install code compliant.   We will need a picture of your water heater as well as where it sits in your garage from the view point of your roll up door.    Also,  please provide me with your home address as well as a contact number so we can begin to process a quote.   Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Our program provides a quality Preschool program in the morning and extended care for clients before and after Preschool. We also provide year round services for school age children and summer camp programs . We are licensed for children ages 2-12. Two days a week attendance is our minimum to assure children are exposed to the cognitive activities and are able to develop skills necessary for Kindergarten. Please let us know if you would like to tour our program in the future. In the meantime perhaps you can call the Community Child Care Council to see if they can refer you to Day Care homes who do drop off services. They can be reached at 544-3077. Ask for there list of providers in your area. Good luck!  Regards, Diana-Director  707 528-6666    >

If you are interested in enrolling your daughter regularly in our after school program, it's open M - F 2:30 - 6:00 pm. The cost is $200 per month, but she must be enrolled in a kindergarten program to qualify. We do not provide transportation.  If you have any further questions, feel free to contact me.
