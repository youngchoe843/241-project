We aren't equipped to do alignments at this time. We usually sub-let the alignments we require to Rossi's Tires, on San Felipe Rd., here in Hollister, when we have a vehicle that requires an alignment to be performed. Les Schwab, or Big O tires can also perform alignments as well. If there are other service items you need for your vehicle, we can get those done, and handle delivering the vehicle to Rossi's for the alignment for you, for a one-stop vehicle service.Â Â  Â  As far as cost, we would expect $210.00 for a four wheel alignment, but it is dependent on whether the rear wheels require adjusting. If within specification, then the cost may be less, as less time would be needed. Should the rear (or front) wheels be substantially out of specification, and requiring shims, or other repairs, then the cost would be higher; we would let you know first, if that was the case.Â  Â  If you would like to stop in, we can take a look at the tires and their condition.Â  Â  Â Â  Thank you,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Rick, Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  G and M Automotive.

Pleasanton North Kumon <pleasantonnorthkumon@gmail.com>|Re: Cost for math tutoring|11/29/2017 22:56:00|11/30/2017 12:07:24|Dear Parents,   Thank you for your recent interest in Kumon at our Pleasanton-North center located in Dublin.   *To learn more about our program and how we can help your child reach their full academic potential, please attend our next orientation and reserve your spot HERE. <https://pleasantonnorthkumon.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?notembedded=1>*   Limited space available.  No walk-ins accepted.   HOW KUMON WORKS:  Kumon goes beyond tutoring.  Instead, children actively develop critical thinking skills while progressing independently through a carefully crafted, Kumon curriculum.  The Kumon Math and Reading programs cover everything from counting to calculus, and phonemics to Shakespeare.  The worksheets enable children to learn new concepts on their own.  Kumon programs allow students to progress one small step at a time through daily practice.  Kumon helps children     - Foster a love of learning    - Progress at their own pace    - Develop good study habits and self-learning ability  The Kumon program is designed to help each individual child to learn how to learn and become a self-learner after long term study. We are committed to help students (from pre-school to high school) reach advance study in one year (study ahead of school grade level), so that student will feel very comfortable in doing school work.  PLEASANTON-NORTH HOURS:  Monday-Thursday 2:00-7:00pm  Saturday 9:30am-1:00pm   Students attend classes two times per week and each class session is 20-30 minutes per subject. Students receive about 15-20 minutes of homework to practice on non-class days.    EARLY LEARNER CLASS:  The Pleasanton-North Kumon center also provides Early Learner Program for Pre-school and Kindergarten age students run by specially trained and certified Kumon instructor.  Our Early Learner Class is designed to help students develop pre-reading and math skill. Students practice letter sounds, counting numbers, and work on fine motor skills. We make learning fun and enjoyable for the youngsters and at the same time provide parental education about how to help students practice homework at home.   TUITION  Tuition is $140 per month for one subject and $280 per month for both subjects, Math and Reading. It includes two classes per week and homework every day. All homework materials are also included in the monthly tuition.   There is a $50 Registration Fee, a one-time $30 Material Fee, and a one-month deposit due at the time of enrollment.  You can also visit our website at www.PleasantonNorthKumon.com for more information about our center.      --- Pleasanton-North Kumon  (925) 556-9888

My name is Anthony Luu and I am the center director for this KUMON center on San Ramon Valley Blvd.  KUMON is a academic enrichment program which help students build a strong foundation but we are not a tutoring center which assist students directly with their school work.  To learn more about our program, we invite you to visit our center with your child for a free assessment exam.  Immediately after, we will review the result of the exam during the parent orientation session and we will explain in detail how our program will assist your child.  You can then decide whether this is the right program for your child.  In term of rate, our monthly tuition rate is $140/month.  There is a one time registration fee of $50 for new student.  In general, we conduct assessment exam for new students on Monday & Thursday at 6PM.  Appointment can also be made to meet on Tuesday, Friday or Saturday.  Please respond with your preferred date and time slot and we will confirm our availability.

We do have the equipment to complete alignments.  We do wheel alignments after automobile accidents.  For safety reason's we take  more time than tire shops do.  We have also taken care of customers that had problems they could not get right else were.  With all this in mind we would be about 150.00.  Dependable Tire & Brake in San Rafael (near us) do quality wheel alignments.  When we have a vehicle that is to large for our equipment we sublet to Dependable.  They should cost less than our 150.00.  Anyway if you would like to have us do an alignment for you call and ask for Andrea to schedule an alignment.  You can also reply to this email (include you phone number) and Andrea will call you back to schedule the alignment.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Ian F <if.then.how@gmail.com>|Re: Cost for water heater replacement|11/30/2017 21:22:00|12/4/2017 16:09:59|Hello Michelle.  Thank you for your inquiry.  Though I could safely, correctly swap out you water heater, I could not provide a permit (if licensing and insuring is what you needed). Further, many plumbers will have resources to dispose of the old water heater.   I believe this may be your efficient bet.  As far as quotes, it would be good to know things like; is it an exact match swap out? Or is the item completely different? Is the old one on such older codes that new accomodations ahve to be made for the new one? (higher platform, Alternate venting, constructed forms to strap to?) Or are you changing to On Demand heating? These things clarified may help with quotes requested in the future.  Thank you.   Ian

I wanted to find out why you need an alignment.  Did another repair shop tell you that your vehicle needs one?  Is the vehicle pulling?  I ask because sometimes, the alignment is thrown out of specification for an underlying reason and, depending on the condition of the vehicle, an alignment may or may not solve the problem.  With that being said, I'd be more than happy to take it for a test drive and perform a courtesy inspection.  That would allow us to confirm whether or not an alignment will do the trick and it is our way of keeping you informed about any maintenance issues before they become major problems.  Let us know if you'd like to schedule an appointment.  Have a great day!  Best regards, Lauren Giver Service Advisor  Los Gatos Auto Service 1460 White Oaks Rd.
