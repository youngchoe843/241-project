Our process starts with math evaluation test, which we use to isolate specific skills that need to be improved. After testing we have a meeting with you to share the results and make a plan for tutoring. Since the program is individualized for your child, you can choose any days and times that best fit your schedule. We offer instruction Monday - Thursday from 3:30-7:30pm.  All KnowledgeQuest teachers are credentialed and we use multi-sensory approach to learning.  With your permission we can also meet with your child's classroom teacher to find out when the specific tests are given, what are the homework and classroom expectations, and what other support may be needed.  The cost for tutoring session is $49 per hour with monthly billing, or we also have the option of purchasing packages of hours at discounted rates. Most of our students attend twice per week for one hour at the time. Testing takes about 2 hours and the assessment fee is $95.

Our hourly rate varies depending upon the type of tutoring you require and the number of hours per week you choose.  *Private, one-on-one tutoring* is $40/hour.  These hours are very limited right now.  *Small group tutoring (flexible hours)* is $20/hour.  With this type of tutoring, you can schedule tutoring as needed, as long as there is space available.  Typically our small groups have 1-5 students, though the average is 3. Tuition is paid at the time of each session.  The benefit to this option is obviously the flexibility, but no time slot is guaranteed.  *Small group tutoring (set schedule)* varies depending upon the number of hours per week that the student attends.  This tuition is paid on a 4 week tuition schedule.  So for a student who comes one hour per week, say Mondays at 4 pm, the tuition for 4 weeks is $68, or $17/hour.  The hourly rate decreases as the number of hours per week increases.  For instance, students who come 3 hours per week pay $150/tuition period, which works out to $15/hour.  Once chosen, the time slot is reserved for the student, but adjustments can be made with proper notice.  For most of our high school math students, 2-3 hours per week is standard for tutoring.  In extreme cases (students who are far behind and/or need a great deal of help for finals) we may start out with a high number of hours per week and then reduce the intensity as the issue becomes less acute.  Please let me know if you have any other questions.

We aren't equipped to do alignments at this time. We usually sub-let the alignments we require to Rossi's Tires, on San Felipe Rd., here in Hollister, when we have a vehicle that requires an alignment to be performed. Les Schwab, or Big O tires can also perform alignments as well. If there are other service items you need for your vehicle, we can get those done, and handle delivering the vehicle to Rossi's for the alignment for you, for a one-stop vehicle service.¬†¬† ¬† As far as cost, we would expect $210.00 for a four wheel alignment, but it is dependent on whether the rear wheels require adjusting. If within specification, then the cost may be less, as less time would be needed. Should the rear (or front) wheels be substantially out of specification, and requiring shims, or other repairs, then the cost would be higher; we would let you know first, if that was the case.¬† ¬† If you would like to stop in, we can take a look at the tires and their condition.¬† ¬† ¬†¬† Thank you,¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† Rick, ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† G and M Automotive.

No walk-ins accepted.   HOW KUMON WORKS:  Kumon goes beyond tutoring.  Instead, children actively develop critical thinking skills while progressing independently through a carefully crafted, Kumon curriculum.  The Kumon Math and Reading programs cover everything from counting to calculus, and phonemics to Shakespeare.  The worksheets enable children to learn new concepts on their own.  Kumon programs allow students to progress one small step at a time through daily practice.  Kumon helps children     - Foster a love of learning    - Progress at their own pace    - Develop good study habits and self-learning ability  The Kumon program is designed to help each individual child to learn how to learn and become a self-learner after long term study. We are committed to help students (from pre-school to high school) reach advance study in one year (study ahead of school grade level), so that student will feel very comfortable in doing school work.  PLEASANTON-NORTH HOURS:  Monday-Thursday 2:00-7:00pm  Saturday 9:30am-1:00pm   Students attend classes two times per week and each class session is 20-30 minutes per subject. Students receive about 15-20 minutes of homework to practice on non-class days.    EARLY LEARNER CLASS:  The Pleasanton-North Kumon center also provides Early Learner Program for Pre-school and Kindergarten age students run by specially trained and certified Kumon instructor.  Our Early Learner Class is designed to help students develop pre-reading and math skill. Students practice letter sounds, counting numbers, and work on fine motor skills. We make learning fun and enjoyable for the youngsters and at the same time provide parental education about how to help students practice homework at home.   TUITION  Tuition is $140 per month for one subject and $280 per month for both subjects, Math and Reading. It includes two classes per week and homework every day. All homework materials are also included in the monthly tuition.   There is a $50 Registration Fee, a one-time $30 Material Fee, and a one-month deposit due at the time of enrollment.  You can also visit our website at www.PleasantonNorthKumon.com for more information about our center.      --- Pleasanton-North Kumon  (925) 556-9888    ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Michelle Chen,autocare,11/30/17 21:53,12/1/17 7:16,Don't do alignments here.

Further, many plumbers will have resources to dispose of the old water heater.   I believe this may be your efficient bet.  As far as quotes, it would be good to know things like; is it an exact match swap out? Or is the item completely different? Is the old one on such older codes that new accomodations ahve to be made for the new one? (higher platform, Alternate venting, constructed forms to strap to?)

I wanted to find out why you need an alignment.  Did another repair shop tell you that your vehicle needs one?  Is the vehicle pulling?  I ask because sometimes, the alignment is thrown out of specification for an underlying reason and, depending on the condition of the vehicle, an alignment may or may not solve the problem.  With that being said, I'd be more than happy to take it for a test drive and perform a courtesy inspection.  That would allow us to confirm whether or not an alignment will do the trick and it is our way of keeping you informed about any maintenance issues before they become major problems.  Let us know if you'd like to schedule an appointment.  Have a great day!  Best regards, Lauren Giver Service Advisor  Los Gatos Auto Service 1460 White Oaks Rd.

As you may already know, Kumon is an after-school math and language arts program. We employ a unique learning method and curriculum that unlocks the potential of children by helping them achieve more on their own. We work with students from pre-school to high school, developing critical academic and study skills. Because we understand that not all children grasp all concepts at the same pace, the program allows the individual needs and abilities of each child to govern his or her own progress. For more detailed information, you can visit: Our website,  <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South>http://www.kumon.com/ <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South>Pleasanton-South <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> Our Facebook page :  <http://goog_325658685/> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> https://www.facebook.com/Kum <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth>onOfPleasantonSouth <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth>  Our center hours are Monday and Thursday from 3-7 pm. We schedule meetings with new parent and students outside those hours. The Parent Orientation is followed by a placement test for your child and it will take about an hour for the entire session.  Before enrolling students we administer a free placement test, and meet with parents to explain the results of the test as well as the Kumon program in more detail. As Kumon is a long-term program we want to be sure to answer all your questions before you make a decision. We encourage you to visit our website and come prepared with questions to be asked during the parent orientation.

We charge flat rate $650 parts and labor  to install customer supplies water heaters. We do not recommend retail tanks  sold at box stores because of the low quality and failure rate, also  warranty is prorated not easy to get parts.  In the Bay Area, it's required  to use a ultra Low NOx water heater. If we supply water heater basic  installations like in a garage location standard 40 gallon should cost $1250  to $1450 in most cases. The price includes contractor grade atmospheric  water heater, part and labor. The contractor grade water heaters we use are  much better than anything you would find at a large box store like The Home  Depot, or any others, but if you go through them cost is about the same if  not more. The parts we replace if needed are new water flex lines, gas flex  line, new water shut off valve, new gas valve, earth quake bracing, sediment  trap for gas line and we haul the old water heater away.  If you would like  to schedule an appointment or free estimate please call Alex at  408-391-7974, 925-363-4965. Or call even if you have more question, we are  happy to help.

If for some reason I were to only have 2 workers the day they come the rate would be $75 an hour for 2.  They will bring all the supplies needed for the cleaning.

They deep clean the first cleaning then I talk with the team and I determine the lower ongoing price.  I will know the ongoing price after the first cleaning.

My name is Greta and I am the Instructor at the Kumon Centers of El Cerrito & Pinole.  Our El Cerrito center is located at 11100 San Pablo Avenue.  We hold classes on Tuesdays/Fridays.  Pinole center is located at 2860 Pinole Valley Road. Classes are held on Mondays/Thursdays.  Students can come anytime between 3-6 pm and stay about 20-30 minutes per subject.  We close at 7 pm.  Kumon is an after-school math and reading program that unlocks the potential of children by helping them achieve more on their own. Whether students are seeking an academic challenge or need help catching up, our individualized programs allow them to advance at their own pace, instilling in them a passion and desire to learn more. They become more motivated to succeed both in and out of the classroom.  Kumon students (ages 3 to adults) see success from the very start. The Kumon placement test will show us what level your child will start in. This will be a comfortable level, where they can achieve success immediately and begin to gain confidence. Your child will then advance step by step. We work on one concept at time allowing your child to master that concept before moving onto the next set of more challenging work.  The Kumon math program begins with counting and ends with advanced applications of calculus. Our reading comprehension program starts by developing pre-reading skills and progresses to critique and analysis of literary works. To complete a Kumon program means that a student has developed into a committed, passionate and industrious self-learner who has all the skills necessary to reach their potential.  If you would like to schedule a free placement test for your child, please contact me at 510-698-2720 or E-mail me to gretachang@ikumon.com. Our monthly tuition is $145 per subject (Math and Reading both for $290 with six-month mandatory enrollment.  Or with one-year commitment, the monthly tuition is $135 per subject ($270 for two subjects). Additional one time fee:  registration fee $50, material fee $30, and administrative fee $20 will apply.  There is a free registration promotion in November.  Thank you once again for your inquiry. The next new family orientation will be Thursday, 11/30, at 6:30 pm in Pinole.  The student needs to come with you.  Please call or e-mail me to confirm the appointment.  I am looking forward to meeting with you to further discuss the program.
