You can sign your daughter up for two part time days (9am to noon OR 1pm to 4pm) which costs $255 per month and then use that and pay an extra $8 per hour if she stays past 4 pm. I hope that answers your questions.  Please feel free to contact me again if you have more questions or want to schedule a visit. Have a nice day. -Sonja >

We are the largest after-school complementary education program in the US, providing our students individualized, just-the-right-level instructions, at the same time developing them to be independent learners.  Our lesson plan for each student starts with a free placement test in order to determine the right starting level and pace.  Students study in our center two times each week, for about 30 minutes each time, working on Kumon classwork and making classwork and homework corrections.  For the other five days, we have tailored Kumon homework assignment.  Our tuition is $129 per month.  Please note that we do not do tutoring in the sense of working with our students in the one-on-one fashion.  We welcome you to set up an appointment with us to discuss our Kumon method and have our Kumon placement test for your kid.  We encourage you to also explore other options if face-to-face tutoring might be a more fitting option.
