We would have no problem doing the job for you, but we are located in Concord, CA and the travel time alone puts you into 2 hours of labor at $130 per hour with a minimum of being there for an hour and a half. Not including misc parts and material needed for the job, you are looking at a pretty high number in labor alone due to the travel. My suggestion would be to get quotes from someone local and if you still would like a quote from us, I would be happy to give you one.¬†Rod Guerra President  Guerra Bros. Plumbing, Inc.

I usually recommend Lloydís tires or Rustyís in Santa Cruz, but I can install any worn steering parts before hand. Usually No alignment is necessary when your tires have worn evenly to this point.

As you may already know, Kumon is an after-school math and language arts program. We employ a unique learning method and curriculum that unlocks the potential of children by helping them achieve more on their own. We work with students from pre-school to high school, developing critical academic and study skills. Because we understand that not all children grasp all concepts at the same pace, the program allows the individual needs and abilities of each child to govern his or her own progress. For more detailed information, you can visit: Our website,  <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South>http://www.kumon.com/ <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South>Pleasanton-South <http://www.kumon.com/Pleasanton-South> Our Facebook page :  <http://goog_325658685/> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> https://www.facebook.com/Kum <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth> <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth>onOfPleasantonSouth <https://www.facebook.com/KumonOfPleasantonSouth>  Our center hours are Monday and Thursday from 3-7 pm. We schedule meetings with new parent and students outside those hours. The Parent Orientation is followed by a placement test for your child and it will take about an hour for the entire session.  Before enrolling students we administer a free placement test, and meet with parents to explain the results of the test as well as the Kumon program in more detail. As Kumon is a long-term program we want to be sure to answer all your questions before you make a decision. We encourage you to visit our website and come prepared with questions to be asked during the parent orientation. Do let us know if you are interested in scheduling a Parent Orientation and Placement test for your child.

"info" <info@maidgreensf.com>|RE: Cost for a cleaning appointment|11/29/2017 22:19:54|11/30/2017 08:22:30|Hi Sarah,  Thank you for your interest in Maid Green.  Our rates for a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom home run between $138 - $204.  This is based on a two week cleaning frequency and sometimes a deep cleaning is needed for the first cleaning  which would run about 1.5 to 2 times the regular cleaning.  We do not charge by the hour unless we cannot see a home first and the rates are discounted for regular service.  What we like to do is come by and give you a free quote, it takes about 15 minutes and gives us an opportunity to  meet you and answer any questions you may have. If that sounds good, we can exchange information via email, or  if you prefer you can call the office at 415.839.6105. What we need to get started is your address and some times  during the day that work well for you. We usually do quotes Monday - Friday from 7:45am -5:30pm.   Thank you for your interest in Maid Green.   Laurie  Maid Green  415.839.6105

We charge flat rate $650 parts and labor  to install customer supplies water heaters. We do not recommend retail tanks  sold at box stores because of the low quality and failure rate, also  warranty is prorated not easy to get parts.  In the Bay Area, it's required  to use a ultra Low NOx water heater. If we supply water heater basic  installations like in a garage location standard 40 gallon should cost $1250  to $1450 in most cases. The price includes contractor grade atmospheric  water heater, part and labor. The contractor grade water heaters we use are  much better than anything you would find at a large box store like The Home  Depot, or any others, but if you go through them cost is about the same if  not more. The parts we replace if needed are new water flex lines, gas flex  line, new water shut off valve, new gas valve, earth quake bracing, sediment  trap for gas line and we haul the old water heater away.  If you would like  to schedule an appointment or free estimate please call Alex at  408-391-7974, 925-363-4965. Or call even if you have more question, we are  happy to help. We always recommend getting a few written estimates so you  know you're getting a good tank and a good price. Phone quotes for some  companies are very far from what they would really charge, always best to  have it in writing.  Thank you for the opportunity to compete for your business, Matthew
