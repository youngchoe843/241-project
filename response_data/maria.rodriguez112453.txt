A typical 2 bed/ 2 bath home ranges between $150- $200 for a deep initial cleaning.  Then averages $90 every two weeks depending on the overall use of the house and specific details such as pets, blinds, mostly flooring vs carpeting, etc...  .

Chaitanya Patel <newark-unioncity@mathnasium.com>|Re: Cost for math tutoring|11/29/2017 9:49:00|11/30/2017 07:48:16|Hi it depends on what grade your child is in and what kind of program you select. Also without explaining how we help, it is very difficult to give you a price. As we give lots of input in understanding child's Math skills. We don't have batches, we assess each student and find their learning gaps and strengths. So all the students have customized learning plans and all the students get one on one Instructions. We also help them with their homework which is free extra time for high school students. But looking at age must be in High school, so it can be roughly around forty per session.  Please feel free to call me anytime with any other questions or inquiries. Chaitanya Patel Center Director Mathnasium of Newark and Union City (510) 431-7587
