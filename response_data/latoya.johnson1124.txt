Cari Barcellos <cari@thediscoverypoint.com>|Re: Cost for math tutoring|11/29/2017 10:06:00|11/30/2017 14:40:20|Hi Latoya,  Thanks for your interest in out programs.  Our hourly rate varies depending upon the type of tutoring you require and the number of hours per week you choose.  *Private, one-on-one tutoring* is $40/hour.  These hours are very limited right now.  *Small group tutoring (flexible hours)* is $20/hour.  With this type of tutoring, you can schedule tutoring as needed, as long as there is space available.  Typically our small groups have 1-5 students, though the average is 3. Tuition is paid at the time of each session.  The benefit to this option is obviously the flexibility, but no time slot is guaranteed.  *Small group tutoring (set schedule)* varies depending upon the number of hours per week that the student attends.  This tuition is paid on a 4 week tuition schedule.  So for a student who comes one hour per week, say Mondays at 4 pm, the tuition for 4 weeks is $68, or $17/hour.  The hourly rate decreases as the number of hours per week increases.  For instance, students who come 3 hours per week pay $150/tuition period, which works out to $15/hour.  Once chosen, the time slot is reserved for the student, but adjustments can be made with proper notice.  For most of our high school math students, 2-3 hours per week is standard for tutoring.  In extreme cases (students who are far behind and/or need a great deal of help for finals) we may start out with a high number of hours per week and then reduce the intensity as the issue becomes less acute.  Please let me know if you have any other questions.  Sincerely, Cari Barcellos
